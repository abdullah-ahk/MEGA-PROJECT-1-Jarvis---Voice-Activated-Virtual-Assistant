MEGA PROJECT 1: Jarvis - Voice-Activated Virtual Assistant
<br>
Jarvis is a sophisticated voice-activated virtual assistant, designed to streamline everyday tasks such as web browsing, playing music, fetching news, and responding to user queries using OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model. It is built to handle voice commands and provide intelligent, real-time responses, making it a helpful personal assistant similar to Alexa or Google Assistant.

<br>
Features:

Voice Recognition: Utilizes the speech_recognition library to listen for voice commands and activates when it detects the wake word "Jarvis."
<br>
<br>
Text-to-Speech: Converts text to speech using pyttsx3 for local conversion or gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for higher-quality responses, with playback managed by pygame.
<br>
<br>
Web Browsing: Opens popular websites like Google, YouTube, Facebook, and LinkedIn through simple voice commands.
<br>
<br>
Music Playback: Interfaces with a custom musicLibrary module to play songs via web links.
<br>
<br>
News Fetching: Fetches and reads the latest news headlines using the NewsAPI.
<br>
